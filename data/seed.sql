Hold the weights next to the chest, at the height of your nipples and press them up till the arms are stretched. Let the weight slowly and controlled down.'

Lead the weight slowly down till the arms are parallel to the floor (elbow: right angle), press then the bar up. When bringing the bar down, do not let it down on your nipples as with the regular bench pressing, but somewhat lower.'

     , 'Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position. Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause. Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.'
