I went into coding right after high school and I have a few friends who do coding in their free time and I want to be able to possibly help them with their coding. I have always played video games since I could first pick up a Playstation controller. The Playstation 2 was my first gaming console I've ever played on and I am always looking forward to learning more about coding and video games.</span><br>

         <span class="caption">Hi, I’m Yvette Clapp.  I have a MBA in Finance and over 15 years of management experience and over 20 years of leadership experience. I recently completed courses in Data Analysis and Project Management.  I am currently attending DeltaV Coding School and am planning on completing all of the courses.I have proven experience of leading teams through process changes successfully.  Many changes I have been involved in improved the SLAs of the department significantly.  Process efficiency is a passion for me.  This passion has generated many process changes that greatly reduces human error and an increase in SLA results. My goal is to continually improve myself and most recently to reinvent myself into a career in website coding where I can utilize my passions to the benefit of the customer.</span><br>

         <span class="caption">Hello! My name is Nathan Hall! I am an Iowan born and raised. I left college part way through my second year to work full time at my current job as a warehouse manager. Being a manager gave me some needed insight to how certain team efforts are best made. Although I was enjoying my position it wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I decided to make the steps needed to put myself into the career path I enjoyed the most, web and software development. That decision led me here, to Delta V, where we have made vast strides towards that end. I am very happy with my decision to move towards a career I want to be a part of.</span><br>
